Allow or disallow visitors from certain countries accessing (parts of) your website


== Description ==

This plugin allows you to limit access to your website content. You can either allow or disallow visitors from defined countries to (parts of) your content.

For instance if you have content that should be restricted to a limited set of countries you can do so.
If you want to block rogue countries that cause issues like for instance hack attempts, spamming of your comments etc you can block them as well.

Do you want secure your WordPress Admin backend site to only your country? Entirely possible! You can even block all countries and only allow your ip address.

And even if you block a country you can still allow certain visitors by putting their ip address just like you can allow a country but put ip addresses from that country on a blocklist.

You can show blocked visitors a message which you can style by using CSS or you can redirect them to a page within your WordPress site. Or you can redirect the visitors to an external website.

You can (dis)allow visitors to blog articles, blog categories or pages or all content.

Stop visitors from doing harmful things on your WordPress site or limit the countries that can access your blog. Add an additional layer of security to your WordPress site.

This plugin uses the GeoLite database from Maxmind. It has a 99.5% accuracy so that is pretty good for a free database. If you need higher accuracy you can buy a license from MaxMind directly.

Please be aware that although this plugin can help you greatly with reducing the number of 'bad' visitors on your website it is not fool proof and those who really want to visit your site may find a way.
This is not a security issue but a simple fact of today. Nobody can guarantee you 100% security as it is a constant battle between the good guys and the bad guys.

If you are sure your webhosting or yourself does not use any form of caching or proxying we recommend setting the "Override IP information" on the Home tab to REMOTE_ADDR
